Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software Engineering can best be defined as the process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining sofware applications.
  Software Engineering is important as it allows companies to reduce costs while offering better services to their customers.
  Software Engineering is also pivotal for problem solving and has helped in creating many solutions such as social media for easy communication.
  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  The development of the first computer programs in the Early Era paved the way for the formalization of the Software Engineering field.
  The rise of Object-Oriented Programming in the 1980s allowed for better code reusability.
  The uptake of cloud computing and DevOps beginning in the early 00s has supported easy deployment of software solutions, enabling scalability.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Requirements Gathering - Obtain end-user requirements. This could be done through interviews and questionnaires.
  Design - Features are detailed through use of process diagrams, screen layouts, etc.
  Development - The code is written to develop the software solution.
  Testing - The software is checked for bugs and interoperability.
  Deployment - The solution is moved to a production environment.
  Maintenance - Continuous monitoring and updates to maintain system quality.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall and agile methodologies defer in that waterfall is linear and uses distinct phases whereas agile is iterative and emphasizes flexibility. Both can be used to oversee the successful development of a software solution. Waterfall is best used in scenarios where requirements are fully known beforehand and are not expected to change whereas agile is best suited for scenarios where the requirements may change and flexibilty and agility is pivotal to the completion of the project.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  The Software Developer designs, builds and maintains software applications. Their work is to understand end-user requiements and deliver high-quality products. This involves designing responsive user interfaes and writing the code to implement application functionality.
  The QA Engineers primary role is ensuring the delivered product meets the standards and requirements. They thus perform tests to identify errors and participate in continuous improvement activities.
  The Project Manager is tasked to ensure a project is delivered on time and within the allocated budget through planning, executing and managing the project throughout its development cycle.
  


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  IDEs are important as they greatly improve programmers' productivity by consolidating useful tools like code editing, compiling, and debugging. An example of a popular IDE is Visual Studio.
  VCS are important as they allow developers to track changes to code and easily rollback to previous versions as the need arises. Git is a popular VCS.
  

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  Constantly changing requirements make it difficult for software engineers to complete a project within schedule. The use of a requirements document which is signed off by the end-user can help combat this issue.
  Attack by malicious actors can bring up security issues for the engineers. To combat this, engineers should ensure they implement secure design principles while keeping up to date with the latest techniques used by hackers and crackers.
  Lack of proper communication and coordination in the development team greatly hampers software engineers. To tackle this, the developers can work with the project manager to ensure proper channels are set up to facilitate constant and efficient communication.
  
  
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Unit testing involves checking specific components for erros and bugs and is done during the development phase. It ensures units or components perform as expected.
  Integration testing goes a step further and combines various components and modules and tests them as a group. It is important as it checks the data from between modules.
  System testing checks for the solution's compliance in accordance with requirements, focusing on areas such as performance, load, and reliability. It ensures the solution is of good quality in preparation for its introduction to the market.
  Acceptance testing is conducted by the end user to find out if the requirements have been met. It is importane as it checks the end-to-end business flow and usability.
  

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt Engineering is the process of crafting inputs to get the best possible output from generative AI models. Prompt Engineering allows gen AI models to produce accurate and relevant responses thus improving customer satisfaction.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  Vague Prompt -> Who is the goat?
  Improved Prompt -> In the sport of football, or soccer as it is commonly known in other locations, which player is considered the best of all time?

  The improved prompt is more effective as it removes all ambiguity by clearly stating the relevant area of discussion.
